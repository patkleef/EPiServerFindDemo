		<title>Difference Between Analog and Digital?</title>
		<text>
		<![CDATA[
			Analog and Digital
<br />As a technology, analog is the process of taking an audio or video signal (the human voice) and translating it into electronic pulses. Digital on the other hand is breaking the signal into a binary format where the audio or video data is represented by a series of "1"s and "0"s. Simple enough when it's the deviceanalog or digital phone, fax, modem, or likewisethat does all the converting for you. 
<br />
<br />Digital versus analog can refer to method of input, data storage and transfer, the internal working of an instrument, and the kind of display. The word comes from the same source as the word digit and digitus.
<br />The digital technology breaks your voice (or television) signal into binary code a series of 1s and 0s transfers it to the other end where another device (phone, modem or TV) takes all the numbers and reassembles them into the original signal. The beauty of digital is that it knows what it should be when it reaches the end of the transmission. That way, it can correct any errors that may have occurred in the data transfer. What does all that mean to you? Clarity. In most cases, you'll get distortion-free conversations and clearer TV pictures. The nature of digital technology allows it to cram lots of those 1s and 0s together into the same space an analog signal uses. Like your button-rich phone at work or your 200-plus digital cable service, that means more features can be crammed into the digital signal. Digital offers better clarity, but analog gives you richer quality. Digital like the VCR or the CD is coming down in cost and coming out in everything from cell phones to satellite dishes. 
<br />
<br />Phone lines 
<br />
<br />Digital lines are found in large, corporate phone systems. Though digital lines carry lower voltages than analog lines, they still pose a threat to your analog equipment.
<br />
<br />Analog lines also referred to as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service), support standard phones, fax machines, and modems. These are the lines typically found in your home or small office
<br />
<br />There are digital-to-analog adapters that not only let you use analog equipment in a digital environment, but also safeguard against frying the internal circuitry of your phone, fax, modem, or laptop.
<br />
<br />Cordless phone
<br />
<br />The very nature of digital technologybreaking a signal into binary code and recreating it on the receiving endgives you clear, distortion-free cordless calls. 
<br />
<br />Cordless phones with digital technology are also able to encrypt all those 1s and 0s during transmission so your conversation is safe from eavesdroppers. Plus, more power can be applied to digital signals and thus, you'll enjoy longer range on your cordless phone conversations.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The advantage to analog cordless products? Well, they're a bit cheaper. And the sound quality is richer. So unless you need digital security, why not save a few bucks and go with an analog phone? After all, in home or small office environments where you may be the only cordless user, you won't have any interference issues. 
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, when talking about digital and analog cordless phones, you're talking about the signals being transferred between the handset and its base. The phones themselves are still analog devices that can only be used on analog lines. Also, the range of your cordless phoneanalog or digitalwill always depend on the environment. 
<br />
<br />Cellular Phones
<br />
<br />Perhaps the most effective use of the digital versus analog technology is in the booming cellular market. With new phone activations increasing exponentially, the limits of analog are quickly being realized. 
<br />
<br />Digital cellular lets significantly more people use their phones within a single coverage area. More data can be sent and received simultaneously by each phone user. Plus, transmissions are more resistant to static and signal fading. And with the all-in-one phones out nowphone, pager, voice mail, internet accessdigital phones offer more features than their analog predecessors.
<br />
<br />Analog's sound quality is still superioras some users with dual-transmission phones will manually switch to analog for better sound when they're not concerned with a crowded coverage areabut digital is quickly becoming the norm in the cellular market. 
<br />
<br />Better Sound Quality
<br />Digital offers a better quality of sound. Proponents of digital claimed too that because digital scrambled up the signals into bursts, it was more secure than analog and can help thwart "cloning," an act of grabbing phone account information over the air in order to copy then resell that information for piracy purposes. By some industry estimates, close to $650 million in wireless services has been coveted by these big-eared crooks, which only adds onto the operator's bottom line a cost that is eventually passed on to the customer. Digital has stronger battery life than analog, and for the most part, better, more modern features on the phones.

		<title>Types of Generators</title>
		<text>
		<![CDATA[
		Generators are used for the generation of electricity and they ensure that most of the essential appliances can be run whenever there is a power outage. Generators of different wattage capacities can be used according to the needs of the individual. The choice of buying the right type of generator depends upon a number of factors like the wattage capacity, voltage ratings, fuel type, fuel efficiency, noise level, portability and price – a prudent choice can only be made if you knew what to look for.
<br />
<br />Stand By – Standby generators provide backup power in homes and offices and are permanently installed outside the house or office building. They are plugged into the electric circuits or home wiring. – The unit turns itself on and off automatically. They can automatically detect disruption in the usual electric supply and begin supplying power within a few seconds. – Propane and natural gas offer a safe, long-term fuel supply and are more environment friendly than gasoline or diesel fuels. – Like any motor, a generator motor creates quite a bit of heat and needs a cooling system to prevent overheating. Standby generators can be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. The major difference is that air-cooled systems are louder and not quite as effective. Liquid cooled systems are quieter and more dependable – and also more expensive to purchase and to maintain.
<br />
<br />
<br />Portable – Portable generators are usually used in places where there is no power supply such as construction sites, camps, etc. These generators are sufficient to run appliances like televisions, refrigerators, sump pumps and furnaces. – Portable systems are wheeled units that require to roll the generator outside, start it up, and hook it up to a power inlet box Portable generators supply electricity to selected appliances through extension cords. – They are fueled by gasoline, which can be difficult to store and transport during a blackout. Carbon monoxide is always a concern in the safe use of portable generators. – They are designed to be used for short periods of time only a few hours at a stretch. As a result, they tend to be much smaller and less expensive.
<br />
<br />A related aspect of generator motors is the speed at which they run, as measured in RPMs. Generators made for the US market operate at one of two speeds: 1800 RPM or 3600 RPM. 1800 RPM motors will last longer and run quieter; 3600 RPM motors are smaller and lighter

		<title>Choosing the Best Antivirus in 2015</title>
		<text><![CDATA[If you want to have a computer that is virus-free and running smoothly, you will need to handle difficult situations, such as computer viruses, malware, spyware and Trojan horses with tact. This does seem hard, but that's because it is. But, the good news is that it is possible, and even you can do it. So, the following are some of the ways in which you can keep your computer running like a well oiled machine.
<br />
<br />Testing Labs
<br />
<br />Needless to say, the easiest way of knowing whether an antivirus is really up to scratch is if the name of a particular brand ends up in the newest computer technology list of the labs. That alone is a vote of confidence as to which antivirus will make a difference when it comes to protecting your computer. The name showing up on one of the testing labs list is a clear indicator that the lab considered the particular product worthy enough to be named on its list. Apart from that, having a good test score once on the list is also another plus point.
<br />
<br />But with all the labs out there, which are the ones that matter? You can use the detailed reports from labs such as, AV-Test Institute, Virus Bulletin, Dennis Technology Labs, and so on. These labs test antivirus software by recreating real world scenarios, so you can rest assured that the antivirus software will work once it is installed on your system.
<br />
<br />Hands-On Testing
<br />
<br />Getting your hands dirty if you know what you're doing is also another way of knowing whether an antivirus is up to the mark when it comes to protection. This is a good way of getting a feel of how the product works. Depending on how the antivirus is able to prevent malware attacks, you will get a better idea as to how powerful the software really is. To test an antivirus, you can use one of the many malware hosting URLs and note the percentage that the software was able to successfully block.
<br />
<br />Multi-Layered Protection
<br />
<br />According to the latest computer technologies blogs, all anti viruses distinguish themselves by going the extra mile when it comes to protecting computers. This means that their protection capabilities go way beyond the basic virus scanning or the real time protection. There are even some antivirus software that can rate the URLs that you visit on the basis of how safe they are. Other antivirus software can also block certain processes on the system from connecting to phishing URL's or malware hosting URLs.
<br />
<br />
<br />It is important to note that even the best antivirus software have flaws too, and those flaws can affect the security of your computer, which is the reason why smart users always keep their operating system up to date with the latest software patches. The trick is to find a fix for a problem as soon as it arises. There are certain vulnerability scans that can verify if all the necessary patches are present on a system or if any are needed.
<br />
<br />Behavior-Based Detection & White listing
<br />
<br />There's also behavior-based detection that can protect a computer against malware threats. Although it isn't unheard of for behavior-based detection systems to flag the actions of legitimate programs as well. White listing is another way to solve the problem of unknown programs. Whitelist-based security programs only allow good programs that it's familiar with to run. While using this approach is not always the best option for different situations, it is a useful one nonetheless.
<br />
<br />Features such as, spam filters, Firewall protection, secure browser for carrying out financial transactions, history wiping, secure deletion of sensitive files and credit monitoring along with a feature called virtual keyboard to foil attempts of keyloggers, are all offered by some of the big names in antivirus software such as Kaspersky Anti-Virus (2015), Webroot Secure Anywhere Antivirus (2015), or Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2015 and so on.
<br />
<br />Ending Note
<br />
<br />While it would be nice if we had the technology that could sniff out a virus like an X-Ray machine at the airport, and pull it out the butt of a program, the sad truth is that it is physically impossible to protect a computer from every virus attack. But, using the aforementioned tips should get you off to a good start in keeping your computer safe from uninvited malware.]]></text>

However, scientists have determined that the eyes of the fowl are more sensitive towards certain wavelengths and light colors compared to the average human eye. Chickens have been observed to be more productive and less stressful towards lamps that mimic the wavelengths from natural sunlight and moonlight on which they also base their biological cycles. Modern LED poultry-farming lamps are built to mimic natural wavelengths, which thus could reduce the average duration of reproductive cycles for chickens and increase the overall productivity of a poultry farm.

		<title>Choosing the Right Headphones</title>
		<text><![CDATA[Choosing the Right Headphones
<br />
<br /> Throw away those cheaply made headphones that were boxed in with your MP3 player- the right headphones won't be in there, guaranteed. You can actually experience music on a whole different level with investing in a pair of good headphones.
<br />
<br />Headphones or earbuds?
<br />
<br />First of all you need to decide if you want earbuds or headphones. Earbuds are more worthwhile for people who don't have much space to store them. Headphones are bulkier and more expensive but you do have the option of getting wireless headphones, which are perfect for jogging.
<br />
<br />DJ-style headphones are even bulkier! However they offer excellent sound containment. A lot of music enthusiasts get them because they don't skimp on quality and offer less pressure on the eardrum, resulting in a much longer listening time and minimal damage to your eardrums.
<br />
<br />Sound isolation
<br />
<br />Once you've picked the type you want, evaluate the sound isolation. This refers to how much you actually hear while outside noises are blocked. Getting headphones with good sound isolation will waste less battery life as you don't need to increase the volume to hear what you're playing.
<br />
<br />
<br />Earbuds and in-ear headphones are generally better at sound isolation when compared to regular headphones. This is due to the sound-proofing seal they provide when inserted in your ear. DJ-style headphones, too, create a nicely sealed environment around your ear.
<br />
<br />Noise cancellation
<br />
<br />Although noise-cancelling headphones block out background noise, they actually sacrifice audio quality as well. Surprisingly, headphones with noise-cancellation do not sound as good as other headphones in noisier environments.
<br />
<br />Frequency range
<br />
<br />The frequency range is another aspect not to be missed when buying headphones. A wider frequency range results in better sound quality. Anything between the range 10 Hz to 25,000 Hz is recommended.
<br />
<br />Try before you buy
<br />
<br />Test them out before you buy them! The best way to make sure you end up with headphones worth your money is to test them out first. You could try on your friends' pair or go to a store that sells headphones and speakers with samples available for testing. If you're looking for a more convenient option, just order headphones from a reputed online store, like wow.lk, through Cash on Delivery and utilize their 14 day return policy if you're not happy.
<br />
<br />When shopping for headphones, be it regular headphones or fancy bluetooth headphones, just remember that you get what you pay for.]]></text>

    <title>The History behind Air Conditioning</title>
    <text>
      <![CDATA[Anyone tempted to hanker for a simpler time must reckon with a few indisputable un-pleasantries of life before modern technology: abscessed teeth, chamber pots, the bubonic plague—and a lack of air conditioning in late October. As temperatures rise into the high double digits across the Gauteng area, it is worth remembering how we attained the climate-controlled summer environments we have today.
<br />
<br />Efforts to control indoor temperatures initiated in ancient Rome, where wealthy citizens took advantage of the remarkable watercourse system to circulate cool water through the walls of their homes. The Emperor Elagabalus took things a step further in the third century, building a mountain of snow—brought in from the mountains via donkey trains—in the garden next to his villa to keep cool during the summer. Marvellously inefficient, the effort foretold the spare-no-cost approach behind our modern-day central air-conditioning systems. Even back then some scoffed at the concept of fighting heat with innovative technologies. Seneca, the stoic philosopher, mocked the "thin youths" who ate snow to keep cool rather than simply bearing the heat like a real Roman should.
<br />
<br />Such luxuries vanished during the Dark Ages, and large-scale air-conditioning efforts did not resurface in the West until the 1800s, when well-funded American engineers began to tackle the problem. In the prevailing centuries, fans were the coolant of choice. Hand fans were used in China as early as 3,000 years ago, and a second-century Chinese inventor had been accredited with building the first room-sized rotary fan which was powered by hand. Architecture also played a major role in pre-modern temperature control. In traditional Middle Eastern construction, windows faced away from the sun, and larger buildings featured "wind towers" intended to catch and circulate the usual breezes.
<br />
<br />
<br />In late 19th-century America, engineers had the money and the ambition to pick up where the Romans had left off. In 1881, a dying President James Garfield got a break from Washington, D.C.'s cruel summer overheat thanks to an difficult device involving air blown through cotton sheets drenched in ice water. Like Elagabalus before him, Garfield's comfort required massive energy consumption; his caretakers allegedly went through half a million pounds of ice in two months.
<br />
<br />With more than 20 years of experience in air conditioning, whereby a quality team of engineers have studied and are more than capable of handling any situation given to them, this well founded team is known as GMF Electrical and want to provide ground breaking project management by supplementing innovative, sustainable electrical solutions to the rest of Africa.]]>

    <title>Sanding – Bring Your Wooden Floor Back To Its Pristine State</title>
    <text>
      <![CDATA[Hardwood floors present astounding beauty to our homes. They offer a cosy and welcoming feeling that gives many people a peace of mind. Nevertheless, a hardwood floor can lose its original glimmer, over time. Floor sanding is an excellent way in which you can restore your floors' splendour. You may have been to a friend's home and marvelled at how their wooden floor looked smooth after properly being sanded. While some people opt to do the sanding themselves, others choose to hire professionals. Whichever approach you prefer, here are some basic tips that will help you achieve incredible results.
<br />
<br />floor-repair.png
<br />
<br />All About the Machinery
<br />
<br />To start, you will need two kinds of sanders to accomplish a proper sanding job – one for main areas and the other to finish around the edges. Never should you think of cutting costs by hiring a low-quality machine, lest you end up with dust all over. You should hire top-of-the-range floor sanding machines that feature integral dust collecting units, in order to ensure dust free floor sanding.
<br />
<br />Owing to the fact that you will need to replace sandpaper frequently, you should go for a belt type sanding machine instead of the drum roller type, as they are easier to handle. If you are doing the sanding yourself, make sure you don't stay too long in one area with the sanding machine. This is among the most common mistakes, be flexible while using the machine.
<br />
<br />There are types of wood that call for special consideration such as pine. Pine gives an illusion of flatness. Without the right equipment, you may end up with a depression in the middle of every floor board. Parquet floor sanding requires a special type of sanding machine as well.
<br />
<br />Tips Before Sanding
<br />
<br />Here are things to consider prior to sanding:
<br />
<br />Ensure you have throwaway face masks – even dust free floor sanding machines produce minimal dust.
<br />Check that there are no floor boards with nails heads sticking up.
<br />Refill any gaps before starting. You can do this with resin filler mixed with sawdust.
<br />
<br />While there are four major types of sand paper needed for the job, some floor sanding experts may use up to seven. The four grit sandpapers include 24, 40, 80, 120 of which 24 is the heaviest and 120 is the lightest.
<br />
<br />During Sanding
<br />
<br />Starting with 24 grit sandpaper, get the feel for sander machine, keeping in mind not to stay in one spot for over-stretched periods. Make sure to sand with the grain; not against it. Move lithely around the floor, in the grain's direction. Calmly turn at the edges of your room, with a continuous movement.
<br />
<br />When you see that you have reached new wood, it is time to use the edge sander for the skirting boards and other areas that couldn't be reached with the main sander machine. Change and repeat the entire process with the 40 grit sandpaper, 80 grit sandpaper, and lastly the 120 grit sandpaper. Next, you will have to leave the floor for some hours, before repeating sanding.

<br />
<br />Conclusion
<br />
<br />It's exceptionally satisfying to restore your hardwood floors back to their former glory. Whether it is elegant hardwood that has been concealed beneath the carpet of hardwood floors whose splendour you have cherished for years, refinishing the floors gives your home a new lease of life. If you consider hiring the services of a hardwood floor sanding professional, Acorn Floor Sanding - renowned parquet floor sanding and dust free floor sanding experts - stands out as your ideal choice.]]>

    <title>Motor Home Safety: Five Ways To Prevent Accidents</title>
    <text>
      <![CDATA[Are you one of those who have invested in used diesel motor homes just a week back? Thrilled to hit the roads with your family and friends? If this is your first rig ever, it means that you have not become the master of the roads yet when it comes to driving a big vehicle. These vehicles are huge and need to be maneuvered very carefully on roads.  
<br />
<br />Be it man-made or natural, there are plenty of risks on the road to make your travel hazardous. However, fret not. Here are five tips to help you drive safe:
<br />
<br />1. Beware of Tyre Blowouts and Fuel Exhaustion
<br />
<br />A motor home is not like a small car that you can easily change the tyres incase of a blowout. Nor do you want to be stranded at the middle of the highway looking for help to change tyres. The best way to avoid tyre blowouts is by preventing its occurrence in the first place. Before you start your journey, make sure that they are inflated. Perform a thorough inspection of the tyres as well as the diesel tank to check for any leaks. . However, despite these proactive measures, if your vehicle's tyre is damaged, be wise not to hit the brakes. A blowout normally exerts a side force on your motor home. In such situations, temporarily speed up rather than applying brakes.  Use the steering wheel to make little adjustments. Once you have control over the direction, simply slow down, pull your rig off the road and park it in a safe location.
<br />
<br />2. Control Your Emotions When Driving 
<br />
<br />If another driver acts irresponsibly when driving, do not let your frustrations get the better of you. Controlling your emotions can make a big difference between a little vexation that's over and done within a couple of minutes to a potentially disastrous accident leading to serious injuries or loss of lives. When traveling in your home on wheels, you are not alone but with your family or group of friends. This means more lives are at stake if you react impulsively.  Besides, motor homes cost in millions, and you don't want that split second of rage to destruct your coveted buy. Remember, repairing an accident torn RV can also run up to millions, apart from spoiling your vehicle history when you want to put it up on sale, a decade down the line. 
<br />
<br />
<br />3. Drive Safely in Heavy Rain   
<br />
<br />Always remember that you are not driving your car but handling a much harder and bigger vehicle. During heavy downpours, steer clear of puddles that build up on the roads, particularly deep puddles which when missed can lead to serious accidents due to loss of control on rain struck slippery roads. Ensure that there is plenty of space between your rig and any other vehicle that is in front of you. Motor homes take longer to decelerate, and wet, slippery roads during heavy showers will only add to your problem. Simply avoid driving in extremely unsafe conditions.
<br />
<br />4. Avoid Driving When Fatigued
<br />
<br />Fatigue and exhaustion turn the safest roads to perilous death traps. Therefore, do not drive when feeling sleepy. Make sure you get enough sleep the night before you are driving your home on wheels. You should also watch your caffeine consumption. Avoid drinking coffee before going to bed. Such beverages will keep you awake and the next day when you drive, you'll naturally feel drowsy.  Besides, control the desire to pile on all those indulgent food and drinks right at your disposal in your vehicle. Before you drive, do not even think of helping yourself to a mug of chilled beer or other alcoholic beverages. Consumption of alcohol will make you feel drowsy, and you certainly don't want to crash down the cliff with your entire family for good.
<br />
<br />5. No Distracted Driving Please!
<br />
<br />The common distractions while driving your motor home include kids playing near the cockpit area or you attending to phone calls. You can also get distracted while adjusting the inbuilt woofers of the music system, munching on that freshly prepared hamburger with one hand as you drive or reaching for a dropped ball your child throws at you. Do not allow kids to enter the cockpit zone when you are busy driving. When driving your rig, focus on the road and traffic rules at all times.
<br />
<br />Remember these safety measures when driving your used diesel motor homes to prevent fatal road accidents. Be a safe and responsible when driving in your rig, whether you are alone or with company.]]>

<br />

This makes it important for you to first get introduced to all such common problems and find effective solutions for them. Although some of these issues may seem to be minor, but they often lead to huge setbacks in terms of benefits.
<br />
<br />Waiting for Equipment
<br />
<br />People are bound to form bee-lines at an equipment in gym during the during peak hours. It's sheer wastage of time to follow the league.

Also, try and have alternative options ready in the back of your mind in case the machines are busy. This way you will stay moving rather than wasting your time waiting.
<br />
<br />Skipping Warm-up  
<br />
<br />Believe it or not, dodging your pre-workout warm-up is a sure shot way to get injured when the workout gets tougher. It is very important to have a dedicated warm-up that involves bodyweight exercises like lunges, squats, push-ups, and jumping jacks. This helps in elevating the heart rate before you plan to attack the weights. If possible, make first set of each exercise you tend to perform lighter than the further ones as this also works as a great warm-up session.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Not Planning the Routine
<br />
<br />Straight walking into the gym without a plan in mind is always a bad idea. Before starting anything you certainly need to have a plan for sure. Your plan of work-out should be well-thought out in advance and it must include the exercises, sets, and reps. You may even include the order in which you plan to perform the exercises.

This can be done by either alternating the exercises or the acute variables which include sets, reps, and most importantly the rest times. To enjoy extended benefits, stick with a particular workout routine for not more than three to four weeks before changing it up.]]>

Gloves are yet another important accessory which plays a vital role in your punches. They need to be comfortable and made of breathable material and superior quality. Gloves also have a tendency to wear and tear easily due to the usage. So quality is something to consider. It is best not to compromise. Always have seperate gloves for training and separate gloves for the ring but both need to be comfortable. Choosing the right headgear is also something that nobody should compromise on. There is no saying where the punches might land and how hard they might land. It is always safe to get the right type irrespective of the price. Protectors and guards are also a must for those privates.


For the training a double end bag, a speed bag and a heavy bag will provide you with all the necessary training. A skipping rope is also a must for those warm ups. Boxing is a sport which involves getting your body temperature high and your adrenaline screaming. The jump rope helps you attain that level before you start training. All the bags need to be made of the finest quality and need to be tethered in a safe way. Quality swivels and hangers need to be used to hang these bags.

Once the right accessories have been selected your stance needs to be perfected. You need to have a steady position with stability. Your position talks a lot about your personality and you also need to be comfortable in this position. The power in your punch is the next thing to consider. Your power increases with practice. Your defense is also something that increases with practice. Calculating and landing your counter punch requires more brain than power. You need to understand your opponent and judge his next move. This training can only be done when you face other opponents and learn from their techniques.

Above all, your equipment plays an important role. The best equipment can be found in all the major leading sports goods outlets such as Amber Sports. ]]>
